      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;bits-of-work&#34;&gt;bits of work.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This September has felt like the busiest month of the year so far. While the beginning of the September marks a return-to-school time for most, for people working at HPE, it marks a start of an abstract writing sprint for HPE&amp;rsquo;s annual innovation conference: the &lt;em&gt;Tech Con&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few weeks ago, I have placed a new little widget on my iOS screen called &lt;a href=&#34;https://prettyprogress.app&#34;&gt;Pretty Progress&lt;/a&gt;, tracking the percentage of time passing through the year. As of writing this paragraph, we are currently at 63% into 2024. Time really flies, and this little widget is a small, at-a-glance reminder of that. It&amp;rsquo;s also almost four months since the last post here. Let&amp;rsquo;s get that fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As April is reaching its ending, the weather in Brussels is finally turning more and more enjoyable. The unpredicatble madness of April weather conditions (we refer to it as the month of &amp;ldquo;April fool&amp;rsquo;s weather&amp;rdquo; in Czech) is drawing to its end. The alleyways all across the city are colouring themselves in lush hues of green (and pink, in case of the cherry trees).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
