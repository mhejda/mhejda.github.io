<h1>About me</h1>
<h2 id="im-matÄ›j-hejda">I&rsquo;m MatÄ›j Hejda.</h2>
<p>-&gt; <em>pronounced as mah-TAY hey-da / [ËˆmacÉ›j ËˆÉ¦É›jda]</em></p>
<p>I am a scientist with cross-disciplinary expertise combining aspects of (nano)photonics, machine learning and neuromorphic engineering. I&rsquo;m originally from Czech Republic and currently live in Brussels, Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª. I have a Ph.D. in Physics from <em>University of Strathclyde</em> (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ UK), and a Master&rsquo;s degree (cum laude) in Nanotechnology from <em>Technical University of Liberec</em> (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ CZ) with my MSc. thesis undertaken at ICFO (Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸).</p>
<p>My main research interest is in practically feasible optical computing (OC) enabled by integrated photonics. I am primarily interested in architectures, systems and the required software stack for OC. Some of my focus topics include programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the context of photonic neural networks, hardware-software co-design and model translation layers for optical accelerators, and neuro-inspired photonic-electronic information processing. My past projects include work functionalization of 2D nanomaterials (at Czech Academy of Sciences) and development of interferometric 3D imaging systems with subnanometric axial resolution (at ICFO), contributing to research which later led to a spin-off company called <a href="https://shinephi.tech">ShinePhi</a>.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity and aiming for real world impact, I deeply enjoy working on challenging problems spanning diverse fields and disciplines, especially at the bleeding edge of technology and with practical application in sight. Besides my core knowledge and skills in (experimental) photonics, I enjoy all kinds of programming, data visualizations and machine learning (PyTorch). I have experience working as a technical contributor for large European (EIC/HORIZON) research projects.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>Following my research focus, it may come as no surprise that my interests include recent developments in AI and machine learning, digital privacy as well as metacognition, behavioural psychology and model thinking.</p>
<p>On the creative front, I deeply enjoy music of various kinds, in particular electronic and alternative. I also <a href="https://soundcloud.com/noyire">produce my own</a> and occasionaly DJ. You can listen to my music on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/60FTQrea74KZkULYPDSyxP">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/noyir%C4%93/1502627750">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/noyire">Soundcloud</a> or any other streaming service.</p>
