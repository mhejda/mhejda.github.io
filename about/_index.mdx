### I'm MatÄ›j Hejda.

-> *pronounced as mah-TAY hey-da / [ËˆmacÉ›j ËˆÉ¦É›jda]*

I am a scientist with cross-disciplinary expertise combining aspects of photonics/nanophotonics, computer science, machine learning and neuromorphic engineering. I'm originally from Czech Republic and currently living in Brussels, Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª. I have a Ph.D. in Physics from University of Strathclyde (UK), and an Ing. (M.Eng. equivalent) degree (cum laude) in Nanotechnology from Technical University of Liberec (CZ).

My main research interest is in practically feasible optical computing enabled by integrated photonics, primarily from the perspective of architectures, systems and the required software stacks. Some of my focus topics include programmable integrated photonic circuits in the context of photonic neural networks, hardware-software co-design for photonic deployment of AI workloads, AI model translation layers for optical accelerators and neuro-inspired photonic information processing with photonic and optoelectronic systems. My past projects include work functionalization of 2D nanomaterials (at Czech Academy of Sciences), development of interferometric imaging systems with subnanometric axial resolution (at ICFO, Barcelona).

Driven by curiosity and aiming for real world impact, I deeply enjoy working on challenging problems spanning diverse fields and disciplines, especially at the bleeding edge of technology and with practical application in sight. Besides my core knowledge and skills in experimental physics, I enjoy all kinds of programming (especially in Python, starting with Julia), data visualizations (mainly PyData stack) and machine learning (PyTorch).

### Work

With the ever increasing importance of machine learning (ML) approaches in our everyday lives, the focus is now also shifting to the hardware used for those AI/ML tasks. While conventional CPUs and GPUs can run these algorithms, their efficiency for such tasks is sub-optimal. This is where neuromorphic engineering comes into the picture. In particular, photonics offer multitude of [desirable properties](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41377-019-0151-0) for such computing systems, and are investigated as an alternative to more traditional (and more mature) CMOS-based electronic neuromorphic systems.

At University of Strathclyde, we investigate neuron-like functionality in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) [[link]](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2019.2931215) and coupled opto-electronic systems based on resonant tunneling diode (RTD) circuits [[link]](https://doi.org/10.1515/nanoph-2020-0177).

 I am also involved in the student community, currently serving as the President of [SCOPE](http://scope.phys.strath.ac.uk/), the Strathclyde Student Community for Optics, Physics and Engineering.

My dream would be to push a young technology (such as a neuromorphic chip) all the way from the lab into a commercially viable product & spin-off company.

### Interests

My research builds on foundations from physics, photonics, nanotechnology and computer science and as such, it may come as no surprise that most of my interests relate to science & tech. These include (among others) developments in AI and machine learning, digital privacy and decentralized finance. I'm also fascinated by how our minds work, and therefore interested in metacognition, behavioural psychology and model thinking.

During holidays and weekends, there's high chance you'll find me roaming and taking photos in some remote places of Scotland (or travelling in general), coding in Python or reading non-fiction books. On the creative front, I deeply enjoy music of various kinds, particularly electronic and alternative. I also [produce my own](https://soundcloud.com/noyire) and occasionaly DJ. You can listen to my music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/60FTQrea74KZkULYPDSyxP), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/noyir%C4%93/1502627750), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/noyire) or any other streaming service.
